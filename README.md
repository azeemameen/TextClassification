# TextClassification

In this programming assignment, 3 models are built to Classify Travel Questions. 

1. A traditional ML classifier s.a. SVM or Logistic Regression with at least 5  of the features mentioned in the paper.
2. A traditional ML classifier s.a. SVM or Logistic Regression with word embedding features s.a. word2vec or fasttext.
3. A NN classifier s.a. an LSTM for classification

10-fold cross validation to evaluate your model is used to evaluate the model. 
Precision, recall, and F-score of each of the dialog act in the corpus, and the accuracy and the confusion matrix of the classifiers can be seen in the output of the python file.
